                <h2>The Gnat<br>&amp; the Bull</h2>
                <p>A Gnat alighted on one of the horns of a Bull, and remained sitting there for a considerable time. When it had rested sufficiently and was about to fly away, it said to the Bull, &ldquo;Do you mind if I go now?&rdquo; The Bull merely raised his eyes and remarked, without interest, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all one to me; I didn&rsquo;t notice when you came, and I shan&rsquo;t know when you go away.&rdquo;</p>
                <p>We may often be of more consequence in our own eyes than in the eyes of our neighbours.</p>

                <p>Every man carries Two Bags about with him, one in front and one behind, and both are packed full of faults. The Bag in front contains his neighbours' faults, the one behind his own. Hence it is that men do not see their own faults, but never fail to see those of others.</p>
