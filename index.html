                <h2>The Gnat<br>&amp; the Bull</h2>
                <p>A Gnat alighted on one of the horns of a Bull, and remained sitting there for a considerable time. When it had rested sufficiently and was about to fly away, it said to the Bull, &ldquo;Do you mind if I go now?&rdquo; The Bull merely raised his eyes and remarked, without interest, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all one to me; I didn&rsquo;t notice when you came, and I shan&rsquo;t know when you go away.&rdquo;</p>
                <p>We may often be of more consequence in our own eyes than in the eyes of our neighbours.</p>

                <p>Every man carries Two Bags about with him, one in front and one behind, and both are packed full of faults. The Bag in front contains his neighbours&rsquo; faults, the one behind his own. Hence it is that men do not see their own faults, but never fail to see those of others.</p>

                <p>An Oak that grew on the bank of a river was uprooted by a severe gale of wind, and thrown across the stream. It fell among some Reeds growing by the water, and said to them, &ldquo;How is it that you, who are so frail and slender, have managed to weather the storm, whereas I, with all my strength, have been torn up by the roots and hurled into the river?&rdquo; &ldquo;You were stubborn,&rdquo; came the reply, &ldquo;and fought against the storm, which proved stronger than you: but we bow and yield to every breeze, and thus the gale passed harmlessly over our heads.&rdquo;</p>
